Hello world. A new born baby has arrived, delivered from that flying baby stork... not a human baby though... a website baby... it's the fifth reincarnation of this website. We'll see where this baby takes us. For now it will take it's form as an outlet for the interesting reads I find in front of my eyeballs. A place to gather my thoughts and attempt to understand them by writing about them and sharing. As a personal project, I'm planning on reading a new book from a major philosopher each month for the next year, and then hopefully summarizing each as I go. So I'll start out by summarizing a few past reads and I'll go from there, probably sprinkling in some others along the way.
