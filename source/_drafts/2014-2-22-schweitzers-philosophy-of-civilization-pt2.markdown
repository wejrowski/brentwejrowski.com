Schweitzer wrote Philosophy of Civilization in 1923.

it failed.. factual obsession.. science.

and you still see this in philosophy today. It often lacks meaning. People in it are often driven crazy. intellectual stimulation, but real reflection on humanity?
And school still.. it's a work machine.. no real value placed on the humanities (?), art, abstract or creative thinking, and there is no reflection in much of anything you learn. You memorize it to pass the test, to pass the class, to graduate, to go to college, to get a job.

In Philosophy of Civilization, Schweitzer's sets out to show that society has a moral problem. Society, he says, is obsessed with material knowledge and progress, it lacks a theory of the universe, and its philosophy had led to meaninglessness and hopelessness which is the ultimate source of the miseries of that time. Society must be ethical, and ultimately is ethical. His goal is to ask if there can be, and try to find, a foundation for thought and theory of the universe that is both ethical and life affirming. Society, he believes, depends on this. (SEPARATE POINT ? >> ? >>) And this can only come when majority of individuals—for themselves—discover an ethic of life-affirmation based on reflection. 


SECTION ON PERSONAL...

> xii if meaningless.. no effect.. to self sacrifice. 

> impossible to convince men if mere declamation

> I do not know how how many, or how few, will allow themselves to be persuaded to travel with me on the road indicted above. What I desire above all things—and this is the crux of the whole affair—is that we should all recognize fully that our present entire lack of any theory of the universe is the ultimate source of all the catastrophes and misery of our times, and that we should work together for a theory of the universe and of life, in order that thus we may arrive at a mental disposition which shall make us really and truly civilized men.

One of the most fascinating things he does is show where society is and how connected the thought of the day was to many of it's problems. He paints such a vivid picture of how this works, and he makes such an interesting and practical connection with philosophy and society.

^^ merge

And it is crazy how connected it was and what it led to. Obsession with progress, science, and materialism..  Darwinism.. survival of the fittest.. over industrialization... the way workers were treated.. MORE HERE... Hitler... [human zoos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_zoo)... *human zoos!*

So Schweitzer talks about this, and ultimately where he is led, the outlook and ethic that he has come to that he believes is simple and practical (FIND QUOTE), something that anyone can understand, grasp, and hold on to is this: **Reverence for life**.

I love that. Reverence for life.
